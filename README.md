# Automated UI Tests with Cucumber, TestNG & Selenide

This project was created as an example to demonstrate the **World / Context pattern problem in Cucumber step definitions**, showing how to share data (product name, price) across multiple steps in a scenario.

It uses:

- **Java 17**
- **Cucumber** for BDD feature files
- **TestNG** for execution & parallelism
- **Selenide** for browser automation
- **Rest Assured** for API automation

It also supports **parallel cross-browser execution** across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.
